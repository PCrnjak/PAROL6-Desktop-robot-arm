If anyone interested I made a horizontal mount for the pneumatic griper. 
2x m4 x 10 for the gripper
4x m4 x 10 for the flange 
1x m4 x 6 for mounting it on the shaft
1x m4 x 20mm for the sensor.

First screw the gripper into the mount into the sunk holes
Screw in half way the 6mm screw into the flange
Mount the flange
Screw in the 20mm long one on the side until the end, It should be flush or extruding a bit on the other side
Bottom down the flange on the motor shaft, and tighten the screw.

When the robot is off try to rotate J6 it should move freely.

Prepare the gripper on the actuator, so you are turning J6+ direction until the gripper is flat. That way when you turn off the robot and it homes again, it will home the same, and not 360 rotated around.

The 2 files are the same STLs, but the "custom" was the first one, and i decided to rebuild the robot with self tapping inserts. The flange mounting holes are prepared for those inserts.
