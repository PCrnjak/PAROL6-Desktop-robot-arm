# Steppers and Gearboxes

Steppers and gearboxes in the build are sourced from [StepperOnline](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/) a Chinese brand with warehouses in the US, EU and UK. High quality gears with low backlash are important for the accuracy of the robot, please use the specified gears. For the motors, if you get them from other sources, make sure they have plenty of cable length and are without any protruding connectors.
