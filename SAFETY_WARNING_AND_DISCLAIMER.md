# Safety Warning & Disclaimer
## Definitions

For the purposes of this Safety Warning & Disclaimer, “PROJECT” refers to all materials, files, designs, models, simulations, URDF/MJCF files, control software, firmware, documentation, and any modifications or derivatives provided as part of this robotic arm project.

# Safety Warning

THIS PROJECT INVOLVES ROBOTIC SYSTEMS WITH MOVING MECHANICAL PARTS, ACTUATORS, MOTORS, ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS, AND SOFTWARE-CONTROLLED MOTION. IMPROPER DESIGN, ASSEMBLY, CONFIGURATION, OR OPERATION CAN RESULT IN UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT, PINCH POINTS, CRUSH HAZARDS, COLLISIONS, ELECTRICAL SHOCK, PROPERTY DAMAGE, SERIOUS INJURY, OR DEATH.

Robotic arms can generate significant forces and move at high speeds. Even small systems may cause injury if safety precautions are not followed. Simulation results may not accurately represent real-world behavior, and transferring control software from simulation to physical hardware introduces additional risks.

ONLY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS WITH APPROPRIATE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE IN ROBOTICS, MECHANICAL SYSTEMS, AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS SHOULD BUILD, MODIFY, OR OPERATE ANY PHYSICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROJECT. ALWAYS FOLLOW APPLICABLE SAFETY STANDARDS, LOCAL REGULATIONS, AND BEST PRACTICES FOR ROBOTIC SYSTEMS. USE APPROPRIATE SAFETY MEASURES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, EMERGENCY STOPS, PHYSICAL GUARDS, SOFTWARE LIMITS, AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.

IF YOU DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ROBOTIC SYSTEMS, DO NOT USE, BUILD, OR DEPLOY THIS PROJECT ON PHYSICAL HARDWARE.
